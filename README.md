# ZoAuth

- [ZoAuth](#zoauth)

ZoAuth is an easy to use authentication sdk and library...
And **this** is the official docs for how to use this beautiful, simple, yet powerful tool. But before we start, I want to acknowledge something. I am so glad that I sat and coded while my friends were playing Fortnite 'coz, well, here I am today! The reason I built ZoAuth was so that authentication would become easy. Something that everyone could do, not just the pros. And I don't **want** others to go through what I went. I want them **not** to suffer. And there's one more thing. If your head is spinning by the time you finish reading this, there's something wrong with you. Blame yourself and not the module. Because unlike most of the docs out there, this one is easy to understand. So don't put all on me.
